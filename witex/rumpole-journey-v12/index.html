Telling users what they need to have before they start, in particular about the receipts they need.   <br /><br />We also considered whether we front-load the login page with a list of requirements for a user - e.g. evidence of receipts, details of the court dates - to ensure a user didn’t have to leave the journey as they didn’t know what they needed to complete it.<br /> <br /> <b>User Research</b><br /><br />We found that users often had no idea about expenses when they started to fill in the current offline form. <br /><br /> They hadn’t receieved any guidance so the info here isn’t enough - they need to know what they can claim for, how much etc before they start the claim, ideally before they incur expenses.</p>

If they earned less, then we would need to know how much they earned in order to pay them that amount. Our hypothesis was that users would find this difficult to know or workout.   <br/><br /> The current form asks employers to fill out the amount that a user would have lost on the day they were off, we didn’t want to use this method in the digital form for several reasons - we’d heard from users that a significant percentage would not want to tell their employer they were going to court, we were not convinced that the calculations would be accurate just because employers were doing it and we didn’t want to add a process that would stop or delay the process because of a reliance on a 3rd party. <br /><br /> <b>User Research</b><br /><br />Some users knew that they earned over £67 a day, but a significant amount of users didn’t know how much they earned per day which would lead them down a route of being asked to calculate it.</p>

Calculating post tax income is difficult and has many variables that can change it. Users who are not numerate or have dyspraxia would find this difficult or impossible. However we put it in to test our assumption that it would cause problems  <br /><br /> <b>User Research</b><br /><br />Users would find it difficult to work this out quickly and accurately.

This is not pulled out as a specific category in the current blue form but has the highest volume of claims in the ‘other expenses’ section.    <br /><br /> <b>User Research</b><br /><br />Users generally were very surprised by this, some thought it made sense but we frequently heard people saying that it was open to fraud and that they thought some people would try it on.
