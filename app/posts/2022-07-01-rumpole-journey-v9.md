title:  Personalised task list variation
description: Should it use the standard linear journey or would a task list or similar be better?

* We wanted to test a couple of different ways the user could move through the journey - a standard linear journey, a task list and a personalised task list where users choose what they want to claim and then see it presented as a task list.

* This is the personalised task list version. 

* tl:dr - it didn't really work as users assumed they were going to put the details in as they were doing the personalisation, and they preferred a linear version.

This meant that users didn't see areas that they didn't want to claim for and had been primed with more info about how much they could claim and what they needed. <br /><br/> <br /><br /> There were several hypothesis behind this:<br /><br /> - Users wouldn't have to go through the whole form and see irrelevant stuff<br /> - Users could fill in each section when they wanted rather than in a set order<br /> - Users can see upfront what they could claim for and get things like receipts ready<br /> - Save and continue would likely work better with this format   <br /><br /> <b>User Research</b><br /><br />It sort of worked, users were receptive to it and were generally positive.<br /><br />They didn't all connect the questions they were asked earlier,  <br /><br />However they preferred the linear version. We also noticed some things that would be an issue, users said they wanted to do receipts all in on go at the end of the process however they usually missed the section to upload receipts in this version.
