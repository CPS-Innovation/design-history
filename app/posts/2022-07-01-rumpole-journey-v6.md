* In magistrates courts over 90% of cases only have one defendant, our original design worked well for this scenario but we needed to update the design to handle multiple defendants - which could be up to 15 defendants in a crown court case (although this number of defendants is very unusual)

* We tried 3 different versions with users. The version with a list of names and a link to more info was the one that best met user needs.

* All the versions open a new tab in the main window with the additional details about the defendants.
