description: First draft of a search and view case file journey
date: 2022-01-06

This is the first draft of a journey that starts with searching for a case file URN, allows users to find that case and open all the documents related to that case in a case viewer. There is no searching in the case files in this version.

<!-- ## User needs

We need to make the most of the screen real estate for the cases rather than the interface. "
