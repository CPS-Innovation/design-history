This was to see how many days they had been away for less than 4 hours.  <br /><br /> <b>User Research</b><br /><br />This and the next screen doesn't really work. Users would put hours into the box, didn't understand that they should put the amount of time away from work rather than the time in court and they didn't know about the next page which made it confusing.",

       caption: "The policy was to pay users a maximum of £67 a day, which is only just above the adult minimum wage per person. If they earned less, then we would need to know how much they earned in order to pay them that amount. Our hypothesis was that users would find this difficult to know or workout.   <br/><br /> The current form asks employers to fill out the amount that a user would have lost on the day they were off, we didn't want to use this method in the digital form for several reasons - we'd heard from users that a significant percentage would not want to tell their employer they were going to court, we were not convinced that the calculations would be accurate just because employers were doing it and we didn't want to add a process that would stop or delay the process because of a reliance on a 3rd party. <br /><br /> <b>User Research</b><br /><br />Some users knew that they earned over £67 a day, but a significant amount of users didn't know how much they earned per day which would lead them down a route of being asked to calculate it.",

Calculating post tax income is difficult and has many variables that can change it. Users who are not numerate or have dyspraxia would find this difficult or impossible. However we put it in to test our assumption that it would cause problems  <br /><br /> <b>User Research</b><br /><br />Users would find it difficult to work this out quickly and accurately. We also had a dyspraxic user who told us it would be difficult for her to use this section if she had to work out earnings.",

For users who are happy for their employer to possibly know that they were in court we ask them to give their employer details so that we can check they are employed. If not, they can upload a payslip to show they were in employment at the time.  <br /><br /> <b>User Research</b><br /><br />Users seemed to understand this and why it was being asked.",

If the user has multiple jobs we only need one employer.  <br /><br /> <b>User Research</b><br /><br />Users seemed to understand this, but felt we should be clearer that this info might be used to contact the employer and check they were employed.",

This is not pulled out as a specific category in the current blue form but has the highest volume of claims in the 'other expenses' section.    <br /><br /> <b>User Research</b><br /><br />Users generally were very surprised by this, some thought it made sense but we frequently heard people saying that it was open to fraud and that they thought some people would try it on. We also heard surprise that the amounts were the same as childcare and an unpaid day off for a person, as well as there being a section for pet care but not adult care.",

Most users on a desktop said they would take a photo of a receipt on their phone, email it to themselves and then upload it.
