title:  Redaction Log
description: Sketches of a GDS design version of redaction log
date: 2022-04-01
tags: redaction-log
---

* We have made 2 sketches of the redaction log journey - 1. Using the GDS patterns in a traditional way and 2. Keeping the GDS look and feel but keeping the general layout of what has currently been built

* The version that uses the GDS patterns in a traditional way would work for a citizen facing service that is used infrequently. However lawyers are used to the existing service and would be using this service a lot, we've found from research that they tend to prefer fewer clicks and to save time when entering info. It is likely (although we have not tested it yet) that the second version would be a better fit.
