* We have made several versions of the redaction prototype and it has changed significantly from where we started with our early assumptions and hypothesis.

* We initially started with redaction being a seperate process from case review - and it sitting in a new tab - because users often treat it as a seperate process. But, we quickly realised that this was only the case because the current system made it very difficult to make redactions as you went along. When we realised this we integrated the main redaction function into the case review page.
* The seperate page for redaction has changed from being the whole redaction process to a confirmation and finally a place where suggestions from our ML are presented.

       caption: "Our first attempt at a redaction concept. We started with the idea of matching the existing process - users don't generally redact as they go but make a note or a tag of where they want to redact and come back later to the note to redact it. We quickly realised that they reason they do this is that it is really awkward to make a redaction with the current system - so if they were to try and redact as they go along it would  break them out of their thought process. <br /><br /> <b>User Research</b><br /><br />Didn't really work, the ideal would be to redact as you go without being broken out of the current task ",
