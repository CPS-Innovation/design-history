* This is the third draft of a journey that starts with searching for a case file URN, allows users to find that case and open all the documents related to that case in a case viewer.

* We made several changes to version 2 based on user feedback. 
* This version still contains 2 versions of search - one that opens results in a modal window and another that opens in a tab. We haven't decided yet which one works better for users.

        - The charges and the case files are listed in the accordions on the left hand side. When the user clicks an accordion it opens to reveal the case files within.
          - The page structure has changed to that the whole page scrolls rather than individual windows, this allows us to use the full vertical space for the document (some users have very small screens and this helps give the docs more space)
        - Forensics has been removed (will go on exhibits) and communications has been added
        - A label has been added to the search bar<br /><br /> <b>User Research</b><br /><br />t.b.c "
